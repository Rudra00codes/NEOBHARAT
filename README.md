# AI-Powered Diagnostic Software Suite for CSCs
[![Banner](path/to/banner.png)](https://www.yourwebsite.com)


## üí° Problem Statement
Underutilized Common Service Centers (CSCs) and a lack of accessible and affordable diagnostic tools create barriers to healthcare access in rural India.

## üí° Our Solution
We propose an AI-powered diagnostic software suite that transforms existing CSC computers into health diagnostic and information kiosks, providing essential healthcare services to rural populations.

## üìä Architecture

### Key Components:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

  #### 1. Presentation Layer (UI)
  - **Purpose**: Provides the user interface for interaction with the system.
  - **Technology**: 
    - Web-based interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for cross-platform compatibility.
    - Framework: React, Angular, or Vue.js for building a responsive and interactive UI.
  - **Key Components**:
    - Login/Authentication Module
    - Symptom Input Forms (with multilingual support)
    - AI Diagnostic Results Display
    - Teleconsultation Portal
    - Health Information Library
    - Data Analytics Dashboard

  #### 2. Application Layer (Business Logic)
  - **Purpose**: Implements the core business logic of the system, including user authentication, data validation, AI processing, and report generation.
  - **Technology**: 
    - Programming Language: Python (with frameworks like Flask or Django)
    - API Framework: RESTful APIs for communication between the UI and backend services.
  - **Key Components**:
    - User Management Service
    - Symptom Processing Service
    - AI Diagnostic Service (integrates with the AI model)
    - Teleconsultation Service (integrates with WebRTC or Jitsi Meet)
    - Data Analytics Service

  #### 3. AI Layer
  - **Purpose**: Hosts the AI model for diagnostic assistance.
  - **Technology**: 
    - AI Framework: TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile (for efficient on-device AI processing).
  - **Key Components**:
    - Pre-trained AI Model (for common rural ailments)
    - Model Inference Engine
    - Data Preprocessing Module
    - Model Update Mechanism (for continuous learning and improvement)

  #### 4. Data Access Layer
  - **Purpose**: Provides access to the data storage layer.
  - **Technology**: 
    - Database: SQLite (encrypted) for local data storage.
    - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): SQLAlchemy or Django ORM for simplified database interactions.
  - **Key Components**:
    - Data Access Objects (DAOs) for each data entity (users, patients, symptoms, diagnoses, etc.)

  #### 5. Data Storage Layer
  - **Purpose**: Stores all data related to the system, including user information, patient records, symptoms, diagnoses, and health information.
  - **Technology**: 
    - SQLite (encrypted) for local data storage.
  - **Key Considerations**:
    - Data privacy and security (HIPAA Compliance).
    - Data backup and recovery.
    - Scalability (consider cloud storage for future expansion).

  #### 6. Infrastructure Layer
  - **Purpose**: Integrates with Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM).
  - **Technology**: 
    - API Integrations with the necessary ABDM frameworks.
