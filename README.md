## üí° Problem Statement
Underutilized Common Service Centers (CSCs) and a lack of accessible and affordable diagnostic tools create barriers to healthcare access in rural India.

## üí° Our Solution
We propose an AI-powered diagnostic software suite that transforms existing CSC computers into health diagnostic and information kiosks, providing essential healthcare services to rural populations.

## üì¶ Architecture
